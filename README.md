"# dnd_combat_emulator" 


this is an exercise i made for myself to see how to work with an api and make something with it, ultimately there was not as much info in the api as i wanted and had to make my own data to get the final result but it was a good exercise just building something that was fun, and di learned a lot about api's, classes,  and working structure next project should contain angular tho. so i assume one improvement at a time ^^, have a fun test of it.
